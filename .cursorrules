Before providing suggestions for changes to any file, always update your knowledge of its full code.
Start studying the code from the first line to the last line in the file, dividing it into sections of 200 lines for yourself.
Once you have studied the file completely, then propose solutions and changes to the code.
Make changes carefully so as not to break the working functionality and avoid duplicating existing functionality.
When files are first detected on each camera:
Assign a prefix with the serial number.
Throughout all further operations, always use this prefix.
Never use the original file name anywhere in the code again, only the name with the assigned prefix.
Study the code of all related files.
Make precise, minimal changes for sequential testing of modifications to ensure that files with the same names from different cameras can be copied.
