    "description": "## Overview\n\nThe GoPro API allows you to control and query the camera to:\n\n-   Capture photo/video media\n-   Get media list\n-   Change settings\n-   Get and set the date/time\n-   Get camera status\n-   Get media metadata (file size, width, height, duration, tags, etc)\n-   and more!\n\n### Supported Cameras\n\nSee the supported cameras from the [BLE Specification](ble/#supported-cameras)\n\n> The documentation assumes that the GoPro is always updated to the most recent version. This is relevant in cases\n> where functionality changes between versions.\n\n## Setup\n\n### Connection\n\n#### WiFi\n\nConnection to the camera via WiFi requires that the camera's WiFi Access Point be enabled. This can be done by\nconnecting to the camera via [Bluetooth Low Energy](ble/) and sending a command to enable AP Mode.\n\n### USB\n\nOpen GoPro systems that utilize USB must support the Network Control Model (NCM) protocol. Connecting via USB\nrequires the following steps:\n\n1.  Physically connect the camera's USB-C port to your system\n1.  Send HTTP command to enable wired USB control\n\n### Authentication\n\n#### WiFi\n\nOnce the WiFi Access Point has been turned on, authentication with the camera simply requires connecting with the\ncorrect SSID and password. This information can be obtained in two ways:\n\n-   Put the camera into [pairing mode](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-Quik-How-To-Pair-Your-Camera?language=en_US\")\n    and tap the info button in the top-right corner of the screen.\n-   Read the SSID/password directly via Bluetooth Low Energy. See\n    [BLE Services and Characteristics](ble/protocol/ble_setup.html#ble-characteristics) for details.\n\n#### USB\n\nNo authentication is necessary.\n\n### Socket Address\n\n#### WiFi\n\nThe socket address for WiFi connections is **10.5.5.9:8080**.\n\n#### USB\n\nThe socket address for USB connections is **172.2X.1YZ.51:8080** where **XYZ** are the last three digits of the camera's\nserial number.\n\nThe camera's serial number can be obtained in any of the following ways:\n\n-   Reading the sticker inside the camera's battery enclosure\n-   Camera UI: Preferences >> About >> Camera Info\n-   Bluetooth Low Energy: By reading directly from **Hardware Info**\n\nFor example, if the camera's serial number is C0000123456**789**, the IP address for USB connections would be\n172.2**7**.1**89**.51.\n\nAlternatively, the IP address can be discovered via mDNS as the camera registers the **\\_gopro-web** service.\n\n## General Usage\n\n### Commands\n\nUsing the Open GoPro API, a client can perform various command, control, and query operations.\n\nDepending on the camera's state, it may not be ready to accept specific commands.\nThis ready state is dependent on the **System Busy** and the **Encoding Active** status flags. For example:\n\n-   System Busy flag is set while loading presets, changing settings, formatting sdcard\n-   Encoding Active flag is set while capturing photo/video media\n\nIf the system is not ready, it should reject an incoming command; however, best practice is to always wait for the\nSystem Busy and Encode Active flags to be unset before sending messages other than camera status queries.\nFor details regarding camera state, see the [Get State Operation](#operation/OGP_GET_STATE)\n\n### Keep Alive\n\nIt is necessary to periodically send a [keep-alive](#operation/OGP_KEEP_ALIVE) signal to maintain the connection.\n\n### Camera Control\n\nIn order to prevent undefined behavior between the camera and a connected app, simultaneous use of the camera and a\nconnected app is discouraged. A third party client should use the [Set Camera Control Status](#operation/OGP_SET_CAMERA_CONTROL_STATUS)\ncommand to tell the camera that the client wishes to claim control of the camera.\n\n### Limitations\n\nGeneral\n\n-   The camera will reject requests to change settings while encoding; for example, if Hindsight feature is active, the\n    user can not change settings\n-   Querying the value for a setting that is not associated with the current preset/core mode results in an undefined value.\n    For example, the user should not try to query the current Photo Digital Lenses (FOV) value while in a video-based\n    Preset.\n",
